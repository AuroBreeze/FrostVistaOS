title: 

i plan to set up the directory structure to make it easier to maintain.

there was a minor hiccup where i couldn't locate the header file, but adding '-Iinclude' to both the .clangd and makefile files resolved it perfectly.

i'm actually quite glad i wrote a Quick-C C/C++ plugin that generates complie_commands.json files effectively, allowing me to quickly jump to the implementation sections of my functions.
